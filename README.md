# Mastermind
This is a creation of the classic Mastermind game where you need to guess the correct order of colours. Each time a guess is submitted indicators beside each colour are given. If the indicator is green, the colour is in the correct position. If the indicator is white, the colour is in the pattern, but in a different location. No specific indicator means that colour is not in the pattern. 

There are 3 modes of difficulty: easy, medium and hard, which vary in the amount of colour options in the pattern. There is also an option to include duplicate colours to make the game harder as well.

This game was made in NetBeans using Java and xml files to store the colours and high score values.
